A Mad Libs generator is a fun word game where players fill 
in the blanks in a story with different types of words like 
nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The game typically 
provides a story with missing words, and players are asked 
to give words based on specific instructions 
(e.g., "Give me a noun," "Give me a verb," etc.). 
Once all the words are filled in, the completed story is 
read aloud, often resulting in silly and humorous combinations. 
The goal is to create funny and unexpected stories by inserting 
random or creative words into the blanks. Mad Libs generators 
can be in the form of books, printable sheets, or online tools 
that make it easy to play and generate unique stories.
